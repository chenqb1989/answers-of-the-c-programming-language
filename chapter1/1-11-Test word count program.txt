It sounds like they are really trying to get the programmers to learn how to do a unit test. I would submit the following:

1. input file contains zero words .
2. input file contains 1 enormous word without any newlines 
3. input file contains all white space without newlines 
4. input file contains 66000 newlines 
5. input file contains word {huge sequence of white space of different kinds}/word 
6. input file contains 66000 single letter words, 66 to the line 
7. input file contains 66000 words without any newlines 
8. input file is /usr/dict contents (or equivalent)
9. input file is full collection of moby words
10. input file is binary (e.g. its own executable)
11. input file is /dev/nul (or equivalent)
